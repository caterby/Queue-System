For this programming assignment, I use java in windows system.
Compute is a separate class for computing the theoretical values.
classes Queueing, Event are together in same package for simulating the process.

For queueing system,

Run:

javac Queueing.java
java Queueing

Result:

It will give all results(E[N], E[T], U, Pblock) for given parameters: L=10, m=2, K=4, mu=3.

For computing theoretical values,

Run:

javac Compute.java
java Compute

Result:

It will give all results(E[N], E[T], U, Pblock) for given parameters: L=10, m=2, K=4, mu=3.
